# Exceedingly Large Numbers Operation 

### Description:

This program is written in Java. I will have a separate repository for a version written in C#. This program adds, subtracts, and multiplies large numbers. These are not your regular-sized large numbers; they are represented as strings that can potentially be up to 500 digits long.

The function takes in two string parameters, representing the two large integers to be added, subtracted, and/or multiplied and returns the result as a string. It does so without converting the entire strings into integers.

Furthermore, bear in mind that when multiplying numbers manually, we align the numbers vertically and multiply each digit of the first number with each digit of the second number, starting from the rightmost digits, and add the results after shifting appropriately.

The subtraction will not result in a negative number, the first number must be greater than or equal to the second number.  

This is an initial version. In the future, I might add additional operations such as division or comparison. Iâ€™ll also add tests, input capabilities, provide input examples, and expand it into additional classes.
